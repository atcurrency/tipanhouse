This is a concept for a Decentraland hotel for the Sepetember 2019 Decentraland game jam.

The concep is a decentralized mini-luxury hotel written completely in code (zero 3d models or image tex).

The lobby features clickable doors that rotate nicely in the center for a more wide open effect, and there are 3 parcels of free walking space around the lobby level.

Simply by standing on the elevator platform, a new floor of the hotel will be created as the elevator platform arrives at the top (optional permanent sky bar or penthouse).

Any room created for you as you stand on the elevator platform (if not visiting an existing floor, if allowed) is actually wider than the lobby, a full 14 meters out of the allowed 16 meters, overhanging the lobby level to allow for pedestrian traffic and virtual car parking.

A full bath will featureI'm exploring other useful bathroom options, but certainly the market tickers, news, or sports will be available via hoverscreens or HUD (Heads Up Display).
